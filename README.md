# Repro

Run `pnpm --filter app deploy --prod out`

### Result:
`ERR_PNPM_WORKSPACE_PKG_NOT_FOUNDâ€‰ In packages/app: "@workspace/missing@workspace:*" is in the dependencies but no package named "@workspace/missing" is present in the workspace`

### Expected:
No error. `@workspace/missing` is irrelevant to the command since I'm deploying in `--prod` mode and devDependencies should be ignored

### Rationale:
A Dockerfile that does not copy local-only dependencies, such as an eslint config, fails on the `deploy` stage
